# AsyncMQTT_Generic
Arduino Library for ESP8266, ESP32, Portenta_H7 and STM32 asynchronous MQTT client implementation. This library, ported to support ESP32, WT32_ETH01, ESP8266, Portenta_H7 (Ethernet or WiFi) and STM32 (LAN8742A Ethernet), is currently supporting only ESP32 (SSL and non-SSL), ESP8266 (non-SSL). Support for Portenta_H7 and STM32 will be added gradually
